# Missing-Migrants

In this missing migrants project,we were able to record incidents where migrants have died at state borders or in the process of migrating to an international destination.This project was handed to us by the International Organization of Migration(IOM) in order to find the leading causes of death and factors that may influence it.In our python notebook that we came up with we were able to achieve this.
We were able to look at the migrants region with the highest number of deaths and also the affected nationalities with the highest deaths.We also looked at the highest number of missing people per region and incident regions that the highest deaths were likely to occur.
We came to the conclusion that most deaths are caused by drowning  and since that is the case we decided that security patrol should be increased along the water routes to reduce the number of deaths by drowning.
